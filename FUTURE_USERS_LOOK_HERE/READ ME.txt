Hello!

I'm Josh Truman, DLS Class of 2026 and NHS Tutoring Coordinator.
I made this HTML and .js as a project.

To install:
Install node
use "node [insert filepath]/backend/server.js"
visiting localhost:3000 should bring it up

To add new members:
Copy all active members in this spreadsheet into a new spreadsheet
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1joM6MCoYlLEAECO8ZX5gaFIihZcE1B6KllFUBWn4HEo/edit?usp=sharing
The spreadsheet updates with data from: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5QZvASTbjcioVojLkgkVvgy2fcxwyH7aWAEUybLnVyHdWDg/viewform?usp=dialog
Download that new spreadsheet as a .xlsx
Name that .xlsx to tutors.xlsx
Replace the old tutors.xlsx in this folder with that file
Run Convert.py
Replace the tutors.json in backend/data with the new tutors.json in FUTURE_USERS_LOOK_HERE
Add all photos to frontend/photos with the exact naming style of: [Full Name].jpeg

To run:
Open terminal
type "nhs"
hit enter
Should get a confirmation message

To set new admin password:
Change adminpassword.txt to whatever you want the password to be
