Hello!

I'm Josh Truman, DLS Class of 2026 and NHS Tutoring Coordinator.
I made this HTML and .js as a project.
If you really need edit access to the spreadsheet or form, try me at:
925 557 0076
jstruman4929@gmail.com
25248@dlshs.org

To add new members:
The code inputs a .xlsx
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1joM6MCoYlLEAECO8ZX5gaFIihZcE1B6KllFUBWn4HEo/edit?usp=sharing
The spreadsheet updates with data from: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5QZvASTbjcioVojLkgkVvgy2fcxwyH7aWAEUybLnVyHdWDg/viewform?usp=dialog
Since you don't have edit access to the spreadsheet, make a copy.
Delete all old submissions (they should be ordered chronologically, so delete any chunks from past years)
Clean all the data to match this example (Make sure to check what people put for "other" for subjects and delete that if necessary):
ID: 12345
Full Name: Joshua Truman (Make sure this name matches the [Full Name] used for the photo)
                        (i.e. if you have "Josh Di-Truman" as response,
                         make sure the photo is named "Josh Di-Truman", 
                         not "Josh Di Truman" nor "josh Di-Truman" nor
                         "Di-Truman" nor "Josh")
Grade: 12
Awesome! Now:
Download as a .xlsx and put it in the same folder as this file.
Name it to tutors.xlsx (Replace the old one if there is one)
Run Convert.py
Great! That part's done. Now:
Add all photos to frontend/photos with the exact naming style of: [Full Name].jpeg
